# Prediction-system-for-accuracy-shooting-weapons-
This system could predict the accuracy of any kind of weapons by some information of the shooter like (height, weight, gender, kind & category of weapons and his position) with three layers first ANN model (Neural Network) second Support Vector Machine (SVM) and last Linear Regression plus the accuracy of this system groth to 92.3% 
By train from old data from other people with similar cases to predict the new one
Note: Should add the data file
